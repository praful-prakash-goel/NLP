# Nemo ChatBot
In this project, I have created a chatbot using dialogflow for a sample restaurant website named PandeyJi Eatery.

I have added the ability to place a new order, update that order and the store hours of the restaurant.

This is a dialogue based chatbot having fixed responses which only surves it purpose.

## FrontEnd
I have created a website for PandeyJi Eatery which contains the menu of the restaurant, location and contact details of the restaurant

## BackEnd
I have used Fastapi for handling the api calls of dialogflow using python

I have used ngrok for creating a secured fulfillment link for dialogflow

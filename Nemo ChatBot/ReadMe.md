# Nemo ChatBot
### [DEMO LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1anCRQkfxnhVAxDvJaOqIo5t9bPaeygwU/view?usp=drive_link)

In this project, I have created a chatbot using dialogflow for a sample restaurant website named PandeyJi Eatery.

I have added the ability to place a new order, update that order and the store hours of the restaurant.

This is a dialogue based chatbot having fixed responses which only serves it purpose.

## FrontEnd
I have created a website for PandeyJi Eatery which contains the menu of the restaurant, location and contact details of the restaurant.

## BackEnd
I have used Fastapi for handling the api calls of dialogflow using python and ngrok for creating a secured fulfillment link for dialogflow.

I have used MySQL for database.
